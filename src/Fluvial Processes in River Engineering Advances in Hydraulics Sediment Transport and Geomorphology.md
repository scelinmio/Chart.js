- You will learn about the latest analytical methods for alluvial channel design, such as the Chang method, the Lane method, the Lacey method, and the Einstein method. These methods can help you design stable and efficient channels that can handle various flow conditions and sediment loads.
- You will gain a deeper understanding of river morphology and its dynamics, such as river classification, bed forms, channel patterns, meandering, braiding, cutoffs, avulsions, deltas, and floodplains. You will also learn how to apply mathematical models to simulate river channel changes and predict their impacts on engineering structures and ecosystems.
- You will discover how to assess and manage the effects of environmental and human-made changes on river systems, such as climate change, land use change, dam construction, channelization, dredging, bank protection, sediment extraction, and river restoration. You will also learn how to conduct risk and environmental impact assessments for river engineering projects.
- You will enhance your knowledge of fluvial hydraulics and sediment transport, such as flow resistance, shear stress, critical flow, hydraulic jump, flow separation, bed load transport, suspended load transport, total load transport, scour and deposition, bed material size distribution, and sediment transport capacity. You will also learn how to use laboratory experiments and field measurements to study these phenomena.
- You will appreciate the importance of fluvial geomorphology and ecology in river engineering, such as the role of landforms and processes in defining and controlling fluvial biotopes, habitats, and biodiversity. You will also learn how to design ecologically acceptable channels and structures that can enhance the ecological functions and values of river systems.

By reading Fluvial Processes in River Engineering by Howard H. Chang, you will gain a comprehensive and system perspective on river engineering that can help you improve your skills and performance in this field. You will also be able to contribute to the sustainable management and development of river resources for the benefit of society and nature.
