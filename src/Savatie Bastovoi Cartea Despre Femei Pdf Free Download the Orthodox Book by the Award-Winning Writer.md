The book is divided into 12 chapters, each one dedicated to a different aspect of womanhood, such as motherhood, beauty, love, wisdom, suffering, prayer and holiness. The author draws inspiration from the lives of saints, biblical figures, historical personalities and contemporary women, as well as from his own personal experience and artistic vision. The book is also illustrated with 12 watercolors by the author himself, depicting various female characters from his writings.
 
Cartea despre femei is not a typical theological treatise or a moralistic manual, but rather a poetic and intimate dialogue between the author and his female readers. The book aims to offer a spiritual perspective on the challenges and joys of being a woman in the modern world, as well as to celebrate the beauty and dignity of femininity. The book is written in a simple and accessible language, with humor and sensitivity, and it addresses both Orthodox and non-Orthodox readers who are interested in exploring the Christian view on women.
