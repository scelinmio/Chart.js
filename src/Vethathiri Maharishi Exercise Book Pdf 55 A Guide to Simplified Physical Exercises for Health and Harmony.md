Simplified Physical Exercises is a book that contains a series of exercises designed by Vethathiri Maharishi to improve the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of the practitioners. The exercises are based on the principles of bio-magnetism, life force, and mind power. They aim to balance the energy flow in the body, regulate the functions of the organs, and strengthen the mind.
 
The book contains 10 types of exercises: joint exercise, leg exercise, neuro-muscular breathing exercise, eye exercise, kapalabhati, makariasana (part A and B), massage, acu-pressure, and relaxation. The book also provides important instructions on how to practice the exercises safely and effectively.
 
The exercises can be practiced by anyone above the age of eight and below the age of 80. They should be done in the morning on an empty stomach or in the evening after a gap of four hours from solid food or half an hour from liquid food. The exercises should be done without any jerks or strain, and with concentration on the movements of the body.
 
The book also contains an epilogue by Vethathiri Maharishi himself, in which he explains the need and benefits of the physical exercises for health and harmony. He says that the exercises not only strengthen the physical body but also regulate all the bodily functions and strengthen the mind so that we are able to free ourselves from the past imprints that have been weakening us. He says that simplified physical exercises build a foundation for our spiritual progress as well.

It also stimulates the production of synovial fluid, which nourishes the cartilage and prevents arthritis. It also enhances the circulation of blood and energy in the body.

This exercise involves lifting the legs alternately and touching the toes with the opposite hand. It strengthens the muscles of the legs, abdomen, and back. It also improves the coordination of the nervous system and the balance of the body. It also activates the acu-points in the feet, which are connected to various organs and glands.
