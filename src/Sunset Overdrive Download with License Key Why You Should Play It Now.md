## How to Play Sunset Overdrive Like a Pro
 
Now that you have downloaded Sunset Overdrive with a license key for free, you might be wondering how to play it like a pro. Well, don't worry, because in this article, we will also give you some tips and tricks to master the game's unique gameplay mechanics and have more fun in the awesomepocalypse.

- Keep Moving: One of the most important things to remember in Sunset Overdrive is that staying still is a death sentence. The game rewards you for constantly moving around the city by using its traversal system, which lets you grind on rails, bounce on cars, wall-run on buildings, and more. The more you move, the more style points you earn, which increase your damage output and unlock special abilities called amps. Plus, moving around makes you harder to hit by the enemies and gives you access to more vantage points.
- Experiment With Weapons: Sunset Overdrive has a huge variety of weapons to choose from, each with its own unique effects and advantages. You can carry up to eight weapons at a time, and switch between them with the directional pad. You should experiment with different weapons and find the ones that suit your playstyle and the situation. For example, some weapons are better for crowd control, such as the TNTeddy (a grenade launcher that shoots explosive teddy bears), while others are better for single targets, such as the High Fidelity (a gun that shoots vinyl records). You can also upgrade your weapons by using overcharge cans that you collect throughout the game.
- Use Your Environment: Sunset Overdrive's city is full of environmental hazards and opportunities that you can use to your advantage. For example, you can shoot explosive barrels or electrical transformers to create explosions or shocks that damage nearby enemies. You can also use water hydrants, fans, satellite dishes, and other objects to bounce higher and reach new areas. You can even use some enemies as weapons, such as throwing OD'd at other enemies or riding on scabs' motorcycles.

These are just some of the basic tips for playing Sunset Overdrive like a pro. There are many more things to discover and enjoy in this game, such as the side missions, the collectibles, the multiplayer mode, and the customization options. So what are you waiting for? Grab your controller and start grinding!
