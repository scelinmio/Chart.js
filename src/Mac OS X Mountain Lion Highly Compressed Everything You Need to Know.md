If you have an older Mac that is not compatible with the latest version of macOS, you may still be able to download and install Mac OS X Mountain Lion from the Apple Support website[^1^]. However, the installer file is about 4.45 GB in size, which may take a long time to download and consume a lot of disk space.
 
Fortunately, there are some websites that offer highly compressed versions of Mac OS X Mountain Lion that can reduce the file size significantly. For example, Ultra Compressed[^2^] claims to provide full and highly compressed Mac operating systems for free. According to their website, they compress the files using premium software and cut the size as much as possible.
 
However, before you download any highly compressed Mac OS from any source, you should be aware of the potential risks and drawbacks. Some of these are:
 
- The compressed file may be corrupted or damaged during the compression or decompression process.
- The compressed file may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
- The compressed file may not work properly or have missing features or components.
- The compressed file may violate Apple's terms and conditions or copyright laws.

Therefore, it is recommended that you download Mac OS X Mountain Lion from the official Apple website or a trusted source. You should also scan the file with an antivirus program before opening it. You should also backup your data and create a bootable USB drive in case something goes wrong during the installation process.
