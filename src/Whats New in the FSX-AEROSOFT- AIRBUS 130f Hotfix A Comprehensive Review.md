The Airbus X Extended add-on has received positive reviews from many users and critics who have praised its realism, graphics, performance and features. Some of the comments from the reviewers are:

> "The Airbus X Extended is the best or rather most realistic Airbus simulation for FSX at the moment. The developers have done a great job in creating a complex but easy to use aircraft that offers a lot of fun and immersion."<cite><a href="https://forum.aerosoft.com/index.php?/topic/64616-two-airbus-x-extended-reviews/">simmernews.com</a></cite>

> "I love this Airbus and Aerosoft has done (and is doing) an awesome job with this a/c and the graphics are by light-years ahead of any (I mean any) a/c out there- in and out!"<cite><a href="https://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/406244-airbus-x-extended/">Johnny767</a></cite>

> "Was never a fan of the airbus till I purchased the Airbus Extended. Great aircraft. Great FPS. Has a vnav issue but the SP for it is do out soon and easily worked around till it comes out. Highly recommend it if you are a Airbus fan because again, I wasn't till I got this aircraft."<cite><a href="https://www.avsim.com/forums/topic/406244-airbus-x-extended/">Irishcurse</a></cite>

Of course, no product is perfect and some users have reported some issues and bugs with the add-on, such as the throttle compatibility, the VNAV logic, the sound quality and the documentation. However, most of these issues are either minor or have been fixed or will be fixed in the upcoming service pack. The developers have been very responsive and supportive to the feedback and suggestions from the community.
