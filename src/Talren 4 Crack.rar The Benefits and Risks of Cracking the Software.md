# How to Fix Crusader Kings 2 Multiplayer Issues
 
Crusader Kings 2 is a grand strategy game that lets you create your own medieval dynasty and rule over it. You can also play with up to 31 other players online or via LAN in the multiplayer mode. However, some players may encounter various issues when trying to play multiplayer, such as disconnects, desyncs, crashes, or inability to find or join games. In this article, we will show you some possible solutions to fix Crusader Kings 2 multiplayer issues and enjoy the game with your friends.
 
## Check Your Game Version and DLCs
 
The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you and your friends have the same game version and DLCs enabled. You can check your game version by hovering over the Crusader Kings 2 logo in the main menu. You can also see the checksum, which is a four-letter code that indicates the game state. If you and your friends have different checksums, you will not be able to play together.

You can do this by going to the launcher and checking or unchecking any DLCs in the "DLC" tab. The game will play as though everyone in the game has the same DLCs as the host.
 
## Use Connect to ID
 
If you are having trouble finding or joining games in the multiplayer menu, you can try using the connect to ID option. This option allows you to join a game by entering the server ID of the host. The server ID is displayed on the bottom of the character/player box as "Server ID". It should be a long number[^3^]. The host can share their server ID with their friends who want to join their game.

## Fix Your Firewall and Port Settings
 
If you are still having trouble connecting to games or hosting games, you may need to check your firewall and port settings. Sometimes, your firewall may block the connection or cause lag or desync issues. You may need to disable your firewall or open the ports that Crusader Kings 2 uses.
 
The ports that Crusader Kings 2 uses are: 2300-2400 (UDP and TCP), 47624 (TCP only) and 1630-1641 (UDP and TCP)[^1^]. You can find instructions on how to open ports for different routers [here](https://portforward.com/router.htm). You may also need to open ports in your Windows firewall or any other antivirus software you have.
 
## Disable Debug Mode
 
If you are getting an error that the checksums differ in multiplayer even after disabling all mods and reinstalling the game, you may need to disable debug mode. Debug mode is a feature that allows you to see various information and commands in the game, but it also changes your checksum and prevents you from playing with others[^2^].
 
To disable debug mode, you need to:

1. Go to your Documents folder and find the Paradox Interactive folder.
2. Open the Crusader Kings II folder and find the settings.txt file.
3. Open the file with a text editor and find the line that says "debug\_mode=yes".
4. Change it to "debug\_mode=no" and save the file.
5. Restart Crusader Kings 2 and check your checksum again.
