To demonstrate the capabilities and features of the Iocomp Components V4 02 Sp2 Full Source package, we will show some examples of how to use the controls in different scenarios. The examples are based on the Getting Started Guide[^1^] that comes with the package and can be found in the documentation folder.
 
## Example 1: Creating a Real-Time Plot
 
One of the most common uses of the Iocomp Components V4 02 Sp2 Full Source package is to create real-time plots that can display data from various sources such as sensors, devices, databases, etc. The Plot Pack controls can handle high-speed data acquisition and display with minimal CPU usage and memory consumption. The Plot Pack controls also support zooming, scrolling, cursors, legends, toolbars, and more.
 
To create a real-time plot, we need to use the following controls:

- IOPlot: The main control that provides the plot area and manages the channels and axes.
- IOPlotToolBar: A control that provides a toolbar with buttons for zooming, scrolling, printing, saving, etc.
- IOPlotLegend: A control that provides a legend that shows the channel names and colors.
- IOPlotChannel: A component that represents a data channel on the plot. It has properties such as Name, Color, Style, Width, etc.
- IOPlotXAxis: A component that represents an X-axis on the plot. It has properties such as Title, ScaleType, Min, Max, etc.
- IOPlotYAxis: A component that represents a Y-axis on the plot. It has properties such as Title, ScaleType, Min, Max, etc.

To create a real-time plot using these controls, we need to follow these steps:

1. Drop an IOPlot control on a form and set its Align property to alClient.
2. Drop an IOPlotToolBar control on the form and set its Align property to alTop.
3. Drop an IOPlotLegend control on the form and set its Align property to alRight.
4. Set the Plot property of the IOPlotToolBar and IOPlotLegend controls to point to the IOPlot control.
5. Add two IOPlotChannel components to the form and set their Name properties to "Channel 1" and "Channel 2".
6. Add two IOPlotXAxis components to the form and set their Name properties to "X-Axis 1" and "X-Axis 2".
7. Add two IOPlotYAxis components to the form and set their Name properties to "Y-Axis 1" and "Y-Axis 2".
8. Set the XAxis property of each IOPlotChannel component to point to the corresponding IOPlotXAxis component.
9. Set the YAxis property of each IOPlotChannel component to point to the corresponding IOPlotYAxis component.
10. Set the Title property of each IOPlotXAxis and IOPlotYAxis component to a suitable text.
11. Set the ScaleType property of each IOPlotXAxis and IOPlotYAxis component to stLinear or stLogarithmic as desired.
12. Set the Min and Max properties of each IOPlotXAxis and IOPlotYAxis component to define the range of values for each axis.
13. Add some code to generate or acquire data for each channel and call the AddXY method of each IOPlotChannel component to add data points to the plot. For example:

  ```csharp // Generate some random data for Channel 1 Random r = new Random(); double x = 0; double y = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)      x += r.NextDouble() \* 0.1;     y += r.NextDouble() \* 10 - 5;     ioPlotChannel11.AddXY(x,y);   // Generate some sine wave data for Channel 2 x = 0; y = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {     x += r.NextDouble() \* 0.1;     y = 8cf37b1e13
