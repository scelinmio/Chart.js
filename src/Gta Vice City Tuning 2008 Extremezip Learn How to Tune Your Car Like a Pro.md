Unity Pro XL is a software used for professional programming of many models of Schneider PLCs, including Modicon M340, M580, Momentum, Premium, Quantum and Quantum Safety applications[^1^]. This software has a lot of features and benefits, but it also requires a license to use. If you want to try it out before buying it, you can download and install a trial version that will work for 30 days. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download the software
 
To download the trial version of Unity Pro XL 6.1, you need to go to the official website of Schneider Electric and register for an account. After that, you can access the download page and choose the version that suits your operating system (Windows XP, Windows 7 or Windows 10). The file size is about 2 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed.

## Step 2: Mount the ISO file
 
After downloading the software, you will get an ISO file that contains all the installation files. You need to mount this file to a virtual drive using a software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. This will create a new drive letter on your computer that you can access like a normal CD-ROM.
 
## Step 3: Run the setup file
 
Once you have mounted the ISO file, you can open the new drive letter and find the setup file. Double-click on it to start the installation process. You will see a welcome screen that asks you to choose your language. After that, you will see a screen that asks you to enter your part number and serial number. You can find these numbers in the readme file that comes with the download. For example, the part number for Unity Pro XL 6.1 is UNYSPUEZTV1X and the serial number is 13345618595[^1^]. Enter these numbers and click Next.
 
## Step 4: Follow the installation wizard
 
The installation wizard will guide you through the rest of the steps. You can choose the destination folder, the components to install, and the start menu folder. You can also choose to install some optional software like OPC Factory Server or Vijeo Designer. The installation may take several minutes depending on your computer speed and configuration.
 
## Step 5: Apply the patch
 
After installing the software, you need to apply a patch that will activate the trial version for 30 days. To do this, you need to extract the file Unity\_Pro\_Patch.zip that comes with the download using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will get a folder called Unity\_Pro\_Patch that contains two files: PrvDisk.exe and Unity50\_1.exe. You need to run both of these files as administrator.
 
First, run PrvDisk.exe and enter the key that is shown in the license file that comes with the download. For example, the key for Unity Pro XL 6.1 is F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0F0[^1^]. Click Connect and then OK. You will see a new drive letter called Z that contains some license files.
 
Second, run Unity50\_1.exe and enter the password Unity50\_1 when prompted. This will create some registry entries that will enable the trial version. Click No when asked to restart your computer.
