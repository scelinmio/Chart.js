If you are a fan of arcade-style shooting games, you might want to check out Sky Force Reloaded, a game that combines flashy explosions, beautiful scenery and massive bosses in single player or local cooperative modes[^3^]. Sky Force Reloaded is a sequel to the popular Sky Force Anniversary, which was released in 2014. The game features 15 stages of intense action, each with different objectives and challenges. You can also upgrade your ship, unlock new weapons and abilities, collect cards and medals, and compete with other players on online leaderboards.
 
Sky Force Reloaded was developed by Infinite Dreams, a Polish indie studio that specializes in creating high-quality games for mobile devices and PC. The game was originally released on iOS and Android in 2016, and later ported to PC, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. The PC version of the game was cracked by DARKSiDERS, a scene group that is known for releasing games with custom installers and cracktros. The game is also available as a repack by FitGirl, a well-known repacker who compresses games to reduce their size and installation time.
