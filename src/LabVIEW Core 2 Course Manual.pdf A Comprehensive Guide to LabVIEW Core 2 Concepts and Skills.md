# What You Will Learn in LabVIEW Core 2 Course
 
LabVIEW Core 2 Course is a two-day course that builds on the skills you learned in LabVIEW Core 1 Course. In this course, you will learn how to use common design patterns to create and distribute LabVIEW applications for research, engineering, and testing environments. You will also learn how to control your user interface programmatically, optimize code reuse, handle errors and events, and use file I/O functions.
 
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

## Design Patterns in LabVIEW
 
Design patterns are standard solutions to common programming tasks. They help you structure your code in a modular and scalable way. In LabVIEW, you can use different design patterns depending on the complexity and requirements of your application. Some of the most common design patterns in LabVIEW are:

- State machine: A state machine consists of a series of states that execute sequentially. Each state performs a specific task and then transitions to the next state based on some condition. State machines are useful for applications that have a well-defined sequence of operations or that need to respond to user input.
- Queued message handler: A queued message handler (QMH) uses a queue to communicate between different parts of an application. The queue stores messages that contain commands or data for the application. The QMH dequeues the messages and executes them in order. QMHs are useful for applications that need to handle multiple tasks concurrently or that need to communicate with external devices or processes.
- Producer/consumer: A producer/consumer design pattern consists of two loops that run in parallel. One loop produces data and enqueues it into a queue or a notifier. The other loop consumes the data and performs some action on it. Producer/consumer design patterns are useful for applications that need to process large amounts of data or that need to synchronize data acquisition and data processing.

## Code Reuse in LabVIEW
 
Code reuse is the practice of using existing code for multiple purposes or applications. Code reuse can improve your productivity, reduce errors, and simplify maintenance. In LabVIEW, you can reuse code by creating and using subVIs, libraries, and packed project libraries.

- SubVI: A subVI is a VI that you can use within another VI. A subVI has its own front panel and block diagram, but it appears as a single node on the block diagram of the calling VI. You can create subVIs from existing code by selecting it and choosing EditÂ»Create SubVI. You can also use subVIs from the Functions palette or from other sources.
- Library: A library is a file that groups together related VIs and other files. A library has a .lvlib extension and appears as a folder in the Project Explorer window. You can create libraries by right-clicking on My Computer and choosing NewÂ»Library. You can add files to a library by dragging them from the Project Explorer window or from Windows Explorer.
- Packed project library: A packed project library is a file that contains all the files in a library and its dependencies in a single file. A packed project library has a .lvlibp extension and appears as a single file in the Project Explorer window. You can create packed project libraries by right-clicking on a library and choosing PropertiesÂ»Packed Library Settings. You can use packed project libraries to distribute your code as a single file or to protect your intellectual property.
