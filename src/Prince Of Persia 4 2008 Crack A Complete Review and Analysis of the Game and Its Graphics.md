## Step 1: Download Prince of Persia 4 (2008) from a trusted website
 
The first step is to download the game from a trusted website that offers safe and virus-free downloads. There are many websites that claim to offer free or cracked games, but some of them may contain malware or spyware that can harm your PC. Therefore, you should always be careful and do some research before downloading anything from the internet.
 
One of the websites that we recommend is [PC Games Download](http://pcgames-download.net/), which offers a variety of PC games for free download. You can find Prince of Persia 4 (2008) on this website by searching for it in the search bar or browsing through the categories. The download link will take you to a page where you can choose from different hosts and download options. You will need a torrent client like uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the game file.
 
## Step 2: Extract the game file and mount the ISO image
 
Once you have downloaded the game file, you will need to extract it using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip. The extracted folder will contain an ISO image file, which is a virtual copy of a CD or DVD. You will need to mount this ISO image file using a software like Daemon Tools or PowerISO. This will create a virtual drive on your PC that will act as if you have inserted the game disc.
 
## Step 3: Install the game and copy the crack file
 
After mounting the ISO image file, you will see an autorun window that will prompt you to install the game. Follow the instructions and choose your preferred language and destination folder. The installation process may take some time depending on your PC specifications.
 
When the installation is complete, do not launch the game yet. You will need to copy the crack file from the ISO image file to the game folder. The crack file is usually named as "POP.exe" or "PrinceOfPersia.exe" and it is located in a folder named as "Crack" or "SKIDROW" or something similar. To copy the crack file, open the virtual drive where you mounted the ISO image file and find the crack folder. Right-click on the crack file and select "Copy". Then, open the game folder where you installed the game and right-click on an empty space and select "Paste". This will overwrite the original game executable file with the cracked one.
 
## Step 4: Play Prince of Persia 4 (2008) on your PC
 
Now you are ready to play Prince of Persia 4 (2008) on your PC. To launch the game, double-click on the crack file that you copied to the game folder. The game should start without asking for any CD or DVD. Enjoy!
 
Note: Some antivirus programs may detect the crack file as a virus or a trojan. This is a false positive and you can safely ignore it. However, if you are not sure about it, you can always scan it with an online virus scanner like VirusTotal or Jotti before using it.
