## How to Use GJB-TTAvantika Font in Your Documents
 
Now that you have installed GJB-TTAvantika font on your computer, you can use it in your documents, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or any other application that supports fonts. Here are some tips on how to use GJB-TTAvantika font effectively:

- To type in Gujarati, you need to switch your keyboard layout to Gujarati. You can do this by clicking on the language icon on the taskbar (Windows) or the menu bar (Mac) and selecting Gujarati. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut keys: Ctrl+Shift (Windows) or Cmd+Space (Mac).
- To type a consonant followed by a vowel, you need to use the matra (vowel sign) that corresponds to the vowel. For example, to type àªàª¾ (ka), you need to type àª (k) and then àª¾ (aa). To type a consonant without a vowel, you need to use the halant (virama) sign. For example, to type àªà«àª· (ksh), you need to type àª (k), à« (halant), and àª· (sh).
- To type a conjunct consonant (two or more consonants joined together), you need to use the halant sign between them. For example, to type àªªà«àª° (pr), you need to type àªª (p), à« (halant), and àª° (r). Some conjunct consonants have special forms that are automatically displayed when you type them. For example, to type àªà«àª (jny), you need to type àª (j), à« (halant), and àª (ny).
- To type a punctuation mark, such as a period, comma, question mark, or exclamation mark, you need to use the same keys as in English. However, some punctuation marks have different shapes in Gujarati. For example, the period is represented by a vertical line (|) and the question mark is represented by an inverted semicolon (;).
- To type a number, such as 1, 2, 3, etc., you need to use the same keys as in English. However, if you want to use the Gujarati numerals, such as à«§, à«¨, à«©, etc., you need to switch your keyboard layout to Gujarati numerals. You can do this by clicking on the language icon on the taskbar (Windows) or the menu bar (Mac) and selecting Gujarati numerals. Alternatively, you can use the shortcut keys: Alt+Shift (Windows) or Option+Shift (Mac).

These are some of the basic rules of typing in Gujarati using GJB-TTAvantika font. For more details and examples, you can refer to the [official website](https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/gujarati/gjb_tt_avantika) of the font designer.
