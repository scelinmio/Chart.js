- It combines most pile analyses in a single program. It calculates compression (with settlement), uplift, lateral capacity, and group analysis all together. Users only need to input the data once instead of several times in different programs. This makes pile analysis easy, economical and time-efficient.
- It is suitable for all engineers, even those without too much pile analysis experience. It helps structural engineers choose soil parameters, and geotechnical engineers choose pile properties.
- It provides smart data find feature that allows users to input N-value (SPT) or CPT and let the program find the remaining data, such as friction, cohesion, density, subgrade reaction coefficient, and P-y parameters. This is very useful for users with limited field data.
- It has a graphical input interface that changes simultaneously with the inputs to illustrate the pile profile. Pile head and load are graphically presented to help users to input data quickly and accurately.
- It offers three ways to input soil properties: 1) input N value (SPT or CPT) only and program find all other parameters; 2) input soil parameters such as C, and friction; 3) input end bearing and side friction (vertical) or p-y (lateral).
- It evaluates the uplift and compression capacity of the pile based on the approaches and methods recommended in FHWA, AASHTO, and NAVY DM-7 (NAVFAC) manuals. The compression capacity is the combination of skin friction and tip resistance. The uplift capacity is the sum of skin friction and pile weight. The torsion capacity is the sum of horizontal skin friction around the shaft.
- It calculates pile settlement based on point load, skin friction, and shaft compression. It provides load-settlement curves.
- It determines the point of fixity and stiffness of the pile for rotation, lateral and vertical deflections.
- It performs lateral analysis under different head-load boundary conditions using the finite-difference method to model soil-structure interaction. This is the same method used in the COM624 program of FHWA. Deflection, moment, and shear along the entire length of the pile are presented graphically in the report.
- It handles group piles analysis under vertical, lateral, and moment loading using the matrix method. It analyzes settlement, rotation, and deflection of the pile cap, and each pileâs behavior under group conditions.
- It can handle batter piles and sloped ground.
- It can handle large-size drilled shaft with or without belled bottom.
- It can handle shallow foundations under vertical, lateral, and moment loading. It calculates bearing capacity, settlement and rotation based on the method recommended by Braja M. Das.
- It can handle tower foundation analysis for transmission towers, wireless antennas, telephone and signal poles etc.
