The original Dungeon Keeper was released in 1997 and was praised for its innovative gameplay, dark humor, and creative design. The game allowed players to build and manage their own dungeons, filled with traps, monsters, and treasures, while fending off the attacks of heroic adventurers. The game also featured a multiplayer mode where players could compete or cooperate with each other. A sequel, Dungeon Keeper 2, was released in 1999 and improved on many aspects of the first game, such as graphics, sound, and interface.
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 was announced shortly after the release of Dungeon Keeper 2, and was expected to be released in 2000. The game was supposed to introduce a new feature called "My Pet Dungeon", where players could create and customize their own dungeons without any enemies or objectives. The game was also supposed to expand on the overworld map, where players could conquer different regions and encounter different factions. The game's subtitle was "War for the Overworld", which later became the name of a spiritual successor developed by Subterranean Games.
 
However, Dungeon Keeper 3 never made it past the pre-production stage. According to Bullfrog's website at the time, the game was put on hold because the company wanted to develop new intellectual properties on new platforms such as PlayStation 2[^3^]. Some of these projects included Black & White, a god game; Theme Park World, a theme park simulation; and Project Ego, which later became Fable, a role-playing game. Bullfrog's founder Peter Molyneux left the company in 1997 and formed Lionhead Studios, which developed some of these games.
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 was officially cancelled in 2004, when Electronic Arts (EA), which acquired Bullfrog in 1995, shut down the studio. EA still owns the rights to the Dungeon Keeper franchise, but has not released any new games since then. In 2014, EA released a mobile version of Dungeon Keeper, which was heavily criticized for its microtransactions and gameplay changes. In 2017, EA offered the original Dungeon Keeper for free as part of its On The House promotion[^1^].
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 remains one of the most anticipated and missed games among fans of the series. Many have expressed their hope that EA would revive the franchise or sell it to another developer. Some have also turned to fan-made projects or spiritual successors that try to capture the essence of Dungeon Keeper. One of these is Dungeons 3[^2^], which was released in 2017 and features a similar gameplay style and tone as Dungeon Keeper.

So, what makes Dungeon Keeper 3 so appealing and why do fans still want it after all these years? The answer lies in the unique charm and challenge of the series, which combined strategy, simulation, and humor in a way that few games have done. Dungeon Keeper 3 was supposed to be the ultimate expression of this vision, with more features, options, and content than ever before.
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 was not just a game about building dungeons, but also about managing them. Players had to balance their resources, such as gold, mana, and creatures, and make sure their dungeons were efficient and secure. Players also had to deal with the personalities and needs of their minions, who had different skills, traits, and preferences. Some minions were loyal and obedient, while others were rebellious and greedy. Some minions were powerful and versatile, while others were weak and specialized. Some minions were friendly and cooperative, while others were hostile and competitive. Players had to keep their minions happy and motivated, or risk losing them to rival keepers or heroes.

Dungeon Keeper 3 was also a game about exploring and conquering the overworld, where players could encounter different enemies and allies. The overworld was divided into regions, each with its own theme, terrain, and inhabitants. Some regions were controlled by heroes, who would try to stop the player's evil plans. Some regions were controlled by other keepers, who would try to steal the player's resources and minions. Some regions were neutral or unexplored, where players could find new opportunities and challenges. Players had to use their dungeons as bases to launch attacks or defend against invasions. Players could also use spells, traps, or creatures to influence the overworld events.
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 was also a game about having fun and being creative. Players could customize their dungeons with different rooms, furniture, decorations, and secrets. Players could also experiment with different combinations of creatures, spells, traps, and items. Players could also play with their minions in various ways, such as slapping them around, possessing them to see through their eyes, or sending them to the torture chamber for entertainment. Players could also enjoy the game's dark humor and witty narration, which added to the game's personality and atmosphere.
 
Dungeon Keeper 3 was a game that promised to deliver a rich and immersive experience that would appeal to fans of strategy, simulation, and fantasy games. It was a game that had a lot of potential and ambition, but also a lot of challenges and difficulties. It was a game that was sadly cancelled before it could be realized. It was a game that many still hope to see someday.
