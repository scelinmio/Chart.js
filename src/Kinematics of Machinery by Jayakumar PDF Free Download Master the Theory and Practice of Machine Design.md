# Kinematics of Machinery by Jayakumar: A Comprehensive Textbook for Mechanical Engineering Students
 
Kinematics of Machinery by Jayakumar is a textbook that covers the theory and applications of mechanisms and machines in mechanical engineering. The book is divided into five units, covering the basics of mechanisms, kinematic chains and inversions, mechanisms for motion transformation, velocity and acceleration analysis, and synthesis of mechanisms. The book also includes numerous solved examples, exercises, and objective questions to help students understand and apply the concepts.

The book is based on the syllabus of Rajalakshmi Engineering College, Thandalam, Department of Mechanical Engineering. It follows the text books by Rattan S.S., Shigley J.E. and Uicker J.J., Khurmi R.S. and Gupta J.K., and references by Thomas Bevan, Ghosh A. and Mallick A.K., Rao J.S. and Dukkipati R.V. The book is suitable for undergraduate students of mechanical engineering who are studying kinematics of machinery as a core or elective subject.
 
Kinematics of Machinery by Jayakumar is available in PDF format for free download from various online sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]. However, students are advised to purchase the original book from Lakshmi Publications or other authorized publishers to support the author and get access to the latest edition and additional resources.
  
Kinematics of machinery is a branch of mechanical engineering that deals with the study of motion (position, velocity, acceleration) of mechanisms and machines without considering the forces that cause them. It is also known as mechanism analysis or geometry of motion. Kinematics of machinery helps in designing, analyzing, and optimizing the performance of various types of mechanisms and machines, such as linkages, cams, gears, robots, etc.

A mechanism is a system of rigid bodies connected by joints that can transmit motion from one body to another. A machine is a mechanism that can perform useful work by converting energy from one form to another. A kinematic chain is a sequence of links and joints that form a closed loop. An inversion is a different configuration of a kinematic chain obtained by fixing a different link as the frame. A degree of freedom is the number of independent inputs required to completely control the motion of a mechanism.
 
Kinematics of Machinery by Jayakumar covers various topics related to kinematics of machinery, such as:
 
- Basics of mechanisms: Definitions, types, and classifications of links, pairs, chains, mechanisms, machines, and inversions.
- Kinematic chains and inversions: Four bar chain, single slider crank chain, double slider crank chain, and their inversions. Examples of mechanisms based on these chains, such as drag link mechanism, Whitworth mechanism, crank and slotted lever mechanism, Peaucellier mechanism, Roberts mechanism, Geneva mechanism, ratchet and pawl mechanism, toggle mechanism, pantograph, Hooke's joint, and Ackerman steering gear mechanism.
- Mechanisms for motion transformation: Straight line motion mechanisms, intermittent motion mechanisms, quick return motion mechanisms, and toggle mechanisms.
- Velocity and acceleration analysis: Relative velocity method, relative acceleration method, instantaneous center method, and graphical method for velocity and acceleration analysis of planar mechanisms.
- Synthesis of mechanisms: Type synthesis, number synthesis, and dimensional synthesis of planar mechanisms. Freudenstein's equation and graphical methods for four bar linkage synthesis.
