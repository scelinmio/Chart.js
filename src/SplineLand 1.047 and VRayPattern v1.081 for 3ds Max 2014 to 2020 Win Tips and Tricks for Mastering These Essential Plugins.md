## What is SplineLand?
 
SplineLand is a plugin that allows you to create and edit landscapes based on splines. Splines are curves that can be easily manipulated and controlled to create smooth and realistic shapes. With SplineLand, you can use splines to generate terrain surfaces, apply materials, add details, modify elevation, create roads, rivers, lakes, bridges and more. You can also use SplineLand to import and export height maps, contour lines and vector data from other sources.
 
## What is VRayPattern?
 
VRayPattern is a plugin that allows you to create and render geometric patterns based on a single model. VRayPattern can generate complex and detailed patterns without increasing the memory usage or slowing down the rendering process. You can use VRayPattern to create brick walls, tiled floors, woven fabrics, fences, roofs, pavements and more. You can also use VRayPattern to apply random transformations, colors and textures to the pattern elements.
