# How To Write A Good Introduction For Gp Essay: A Guide For Students
  
A general paper (GP) essay is a type of academic writing that requires you to analyze a topic and present your own perspective on it.

One of the most important parts of a GP essay is the introduction. The introduction sets the tone and direction for your essay, and it should capture the attention and interest of your reader. A good introduction should also provide some background information on your topic, state your main argument or thesis statement, and outline the structure of your essay. In this article, we will show you how to write a good introduction for a GP essay using four simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Hook your reader
  
The first sentence of your introduction should be a hook that grabs your reader's attention and makes them want to read more. A hook can be a question, a quote, a statistic, a fact, an anecdote, or anything else that relates to your topic and sparks curiosity. For example, if you are writing about the impact of social media on society, you could start with a question like this:
  
*Did you know that the average person spends more than two hours a day on social media?*
  
This hook introduces your topic in an interesting way and invites your reader to think about how social media affects their own lives.
  
## Step 2: Provide background information
  
After the hook, you should provide some background information on your topic to help your reader understand the context and scope of your essay. Background information can include definitions, explanations, history, current trends, or relevant facts that establish the significance and relevance of your topic. For example, continuing with the social media topic, you could write something like this:
  
*Social media is a term that refers to various online platforms that allow people to create and share content, such as text, images, videos, and audio. Some of the most popular social media platforms are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. Social media has become an integral part of modern life, influencing how we communicate, learn, work, entertain ourselves, and form opinions.*
  
This background information gives your reader an overview of what social media is and why it is important to discuss its impact on society.

## Step 3: State your thesis statement
  
The next step is to state your thesis statement âthe main point or argument of your essay. Your thesis statement should be clear, concise, and specific. It should also take a position on your topic and indicate how you will support it in the rest of your essay. For example, if you are writing about the positive and negative effects of social media on society, you could write a thesis statement like this:
  
*While social media has some benefits for society, such as promoting education, awareness, and connectivity, it also has some drawbacks, such as increasing cyberbullying, misinformation, and isolation.*
  
This thesis statement expresses your opinion on the topic and outlines the main points that you will discuss in your essay.
  
## Step 4: Outline the structure of your essay
  
The final step is to outline the structure of your essay âthe main sections or paragraphs that you will use to develop and support your thesis statement. An outline helps you organize your ideas and guide your reader through your essay. A typical GP essay consists of three main parts: an introduction (where you are now), a body (where you present your arguments and evidence), and a conclusion (where you summarize and restate your main point). For example, based on the thesis statement above, you could outline your essay like this:
  
*In this essay, I will first discuss the positive effects of social media on society, such as promoting education, awareness, and connectivity. Then I will examine the negative effects of social media on society, such as increasing cyberbullying, misinformation, and isolation. Finally I will conclude by weighing the pros and*
